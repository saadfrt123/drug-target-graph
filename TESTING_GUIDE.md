# 🧪 Interactive Cascade Integration - Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All phases finished! The cascade effects are now integrated into the Drug Search page with interactive neovis.js visualization.

---

## 🔄 Step 1: Restart the Streamlit App

The app is currently running with the old code. You need to restart it to see the new features:

**In your terminal:**
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the current app
2. Run: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
3. Open: http://localhost:8501

**Or just refresh if hot-reload is enabled**

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Test the Integration

### **Test 1: Navigate to Drug Search** ✅
1. Open the app
2. Click **"🔍 Search Drugs"** in the sidebar
3. Verify page loads without errors

### **Test 2: Search for Aspirin** ✅
1. Type "aspirin" in the search box (or click "Try: Aspirin" button)
2. Select "aspirin" from the results dropdown
3. Verify drug details appear
4. Scroll down past the drug-target network

### **Test 3: Find Cascade Section** ✅
1. Look for **"🌊 Interactive Cascade Effects Visualization"** section
2. Should appear after the drug-target network
3. Should show targets as expandable sections

### **Test 4: Expand Target and View Cascade** ✅
1. Click on **"🎯 aspirin → PTGS2 (Interactive Network)"** to expand
2. You should see the cascade we predicted earlier (aspirin → PTGS2)
3. Should show:
   - Visualization controls (depth, confidence sliders)
   - Interactive neovis.js network
   - Tabs with effects (Summary, Direct, Secondary, All Data)

### **Test 5: Interact with Neovis Network** ✅
1. Try clicking and dragging nodes
2. Try scrolling to zoom in/out
3. Try clicking on a node to see details
4. Hover over edges to see confidence scores
5. Use control buttons (Stabilize, Reload, Reset)

### **Test 6: Test Controls** ✅
1. **Toggle "Show Cascade"** checkbox - network should update
2. **Move Depth slider** (1 → 2 → 3) - network should show more/fewer effects
3. **Adjust Confidence slider** - lower confidence effects should appear/disappear

### **Test 7: View Effect Details** ✅
1. Click on tabs: **Summary, Direct, Secondary, All Data**
2. Verify each tab shows appropriate information
3. Check metrics are correct
4. Try the **"📥 Download as CSV"** button in All Data tab

### **Test 8: Predict New Cascade** ✅
1. Expand another target (if aspirin has multiple targets)
2. If no cascade exists, you'll see **"🤖 Predict"** button
3. Click it and wait 5-15 seconds
4. New cascade should appear

### **Test 9: Test with Different Drug** ✅
1. Search for **"metformin"** or **"morphine"**
2. Select the drug
3. Scroll to cascade section
4. Expand a target
5. Predict cascade (if not exists)
6. Verify network renders and is interactive

### **Test 10: Test Old Cascade Page** ✅
1. Navigate to **"🌊 Cascade Analysis"** in sidebar
2. Should show redirect page with instructions
3. Explains new integrated location
4. May keep advanced batch features

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Neovis network doesn't appear**

**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Verify Neo4j Aura is accessible
3. Check .env credentials are correct

**Fix:**
- Make sure neovis_component.py is in project directory
- Verify import statement works
- Check browser supports neovis.js (modern browsers)

### **Issue: "Cannot import neovis_component"**

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls neovis_component.py

# Make sure you're in project directory
cd C:\Users\saad.waseem\drug-target-graph
```

### **Issue: Network shows but is not interactive**

**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- Verify JavaScript is enabled
- Try different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### **Issue: Predictions don't appear**

**Check:**
- GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env
- Cascade predictor initialized without errors
- Check logs for API errors

### **Issue: "Credentials exposed in client-side code"**

**Note:** This is expected with neovis.js. The credentials are embedded in the HTML/JavaScript sent to the browser. For production, consider:
- Using Neo4j Aura with IP whitelisting
- Setting up a backend proxy
- Using temporary tokens instead of passwords

## 📊 Expected Results

### **For aspirin → PTGS2:**

**Network should show:**
```
[Aspirin] ──► [PTGS2] ──► [PGE2] (98% confidence)
                      ──► [PGI2] (95% confidence)
                      ──► [Pain perception] (90% confidence)
                           └──► [Fever] (85% confidence)
```

**Direct Effects Tab:**
- Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) - inhibited (98%)
- Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) - inhibited (95%)
- Thromboxane A2 - modulated (70%)

**Secondary Effects Tab:**
- Pain perception - downregulated (90%)
- Fever - downregulated (85%)
- Platelet aggregation - modulated (60%)
