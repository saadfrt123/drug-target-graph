```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ "Cascade schema created successfully" message
- ‚úÖ No errors in Neo4j

---

## Phase 2: Test Basic Cascade Prediction (20 minutes)

### Step 2.1: First Prediction - Aspirin ‚Üí COX-2 (10 mins)

**In Streamlit App:**
1. Navigate to **üåä Cascade Analysis**
2. Go to **üîç Predict Cascade** tab
3. Configure:
   - **Drug:** aspirin
   - **Target:** PTGS2 (or search for COX-2 related targets)
   - **Depth:** 2 (recommended for first test)
   - **Min Confidence:** 0.6
   - **Force New Prediction:** Unchecked (uses cache if available)
4. Click **ü§ñ Predict Cascade Effects**
5. Wait 5-15 seconds for AI prediction

**Expected Results:**
- Direct effects (3-5 items):
  - Prostaglandin synthesis pathway - inhibited (conf: ~0.90-0.95)
  - PGE2 production - reduced (conf: ~0.85-0.95)
  - Arachidonic acid pathway - affected (conf: ~0.80-0.90)
  
- Secondary effects (2-4 items):
  - Inflammation response - downregulated (conf: ~0.75-0.90)
  - Pain signaling - reduced (conf: ~0.70-0.85)
  - Platelet aggregation - inhibited (conf: ~0.70-0.85)

**Document:**
- [ ] Screenshot results
- [ ] Note confidence scores
- [ ] Check if predictions make biological sense

### Step 2.2: Validate Against Known Biology (10 mins)

**Compare AI predictions with known facts:**

**Known Aspirin ‚Üí COX-2 Effects:**
1. ‚úÖ Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis (CORRECT)
2. ‚úÖ Reduces inflammation (CORRECT)
3. ‚úÖ Reduces platelet aggregation (CORRECT)
4. ‚úÖ Affects arachidonic acid pathway (CORRECT)

**Validation Questions:**
- [ ] Do high-confidence predictions (>0.8) match literature?
- [ ] Are predictions biologically plausible?
- [ ] Are entity types correct (Pathway vs Gene vs Metabolite)?
- [ ] Is reasoning provided by AI reasonable?

---

## Phase 3: Test Different Scenarios (30 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Test Different Depth Levels (10 mins)

**Same drug-target pair (aspirin ‚Üí PTGS2) with different depths:**

**Depth = 1 (Direct effects only):**
- [ ] Predict with depth=1
- [ ] Expect: 3-5 direct effects only
- [ ] Faster prediction (~5 seconds)

**Depth = 2 (Direct + Secondary):**
- [ ] Predict with depth=2
- [ ] Expect: 3-5 direct + 2-4 secondary effects
- [ ] Moderate speed (~10 seconds)

**Depth = 3 (Full cascade):**
- [ ] Predict with depth=3
- [ ] Expect: Full cascade with tertiary effects
- [ ] Slower prediction (~15-20 seconds)

**Compare:** Which depth gives best balance of detail vs. speed?

### Step 3.2: Test Different Drug-Target Pairs (20 mins)

**Test 2-3 additional pairs:**

**Test Pair 2: Well-known drug**
```
Drug: metformin
Target: Find target in dropdown (likely AMPK-related)
Depth: 2
Expected: Glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity effects
```

**Test Pair 3: Different class**
```
Drug: morphine
Target: OPRM1 (mu-opioid receptor)
Depth: 2
Expected: G-protein signaling, pain pathway, respiratory effects
```

**Test Pair 4: Your choice**
```
Drug: [Pick a drug you're familiar with]
Target: [Pick its primary target]
Depth: 2
Expected: [Your hypothesis of what effects should appear]
```

**Document for each:**
- [ ] Prediction time
- [ ] Number of effects predicted
- [ ] Average confidence score
- [ ] Top 3 most interesting predictions
- [ ] Any surprising/unexpected predictions

Additional Context: [empty]
```

**With context:**
```
Drug: aspirin
Target: PTGS2
Additional Context: "Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-2 enzyme through acetylation"
```

**Compare:**
- [ ] Are predictions more specific with context?
- [ ] Does confidence change?
- [ ] Is reasoning more detailed?

### Step 6.3: Explore Visualizations (5 mins)

For a completed prediction, examine:

**Confidence Distribution Chart:**
- [ ] Histogram shows spread of confidence scores
- [ ] Color-coded by depth
- [ ] Interactive (hover shows details)

**Entity Type Distribution:**
- [ ] Pie chart shows breakdown
- [ ] Pathways, Genes, Metabolites, etc.
- [ ] Proportions make sense

---

## Phase 7: Data Verification in Neo4j (15 minutes)

### Step 7.1: Query Neo4j Database (10 mins)

**Open Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474)**

**Query 1: Check cascade nodes created**
```cypher
// Count cascade-related nodes
MATCH (p:Pathway) RETURN count(p) as pathways
UNION
MATCH (g:Gene) RETURN count(g) as genes
UNION
MATCH (m:Metabolite) RETURN count(m) as metabolites
UNION
MATCH (cp:CellularProcess) RETURN count(cp) as processes
```

**Expected:** Multiple nodes of each type

**Query 2: View a specific cascade**
```cypher
// View cascade for aspirin ‚Üí PTGS2
MATCH (t:Target {name: "PTGS2"})-[r:AFFECTS_DOWNSTREAM]->(e)
RETURN t, r, e
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Expected:** 
- Multiple relationships shown
- Each with confidence, reasoning, depth properties
- Connected to Pathway/Gene/Metabolite nodes

**Query 3: Cascade statistics**
```cypher
// Overall statistics
MATCH ()-[r:AFFECTS_DOWNSTREAM]->()
RETURN 
  count(r) as total_relationships,
  avg(r.confidence) as avg_confidence,
  count(DISTINCT r.drug_context) as unique_drugs
```

**Expected:**
- Total relationships > 0
- Average confidence ~0.75-0.85
- Unique drugs = number of drugs you tested

### Step 7.2: Data Quality Check (5 mins)

**Verify data integrity:**

```cypher
// Check for required properties
MATCH ()-[r:AFFECTS_DOWNSTREAM]->()
WHERE r.confidence IS NULL 
   OR r.reasoning IS NULL
   OR r.depth IS NULL
RETURN count(r) as missing_properties
```

**Expected:** 0 (all relationships should have required properties)

```cypher
// Check confidence ranges
MATCH ()-[r:AFFECTS_DOWNSTREAM]->()
WHERE r.confidence < 0 OR r.confidence > 1
RETURN count(r) as invalid_confidence
```

**Expected:** 0 (all confidence scores should be 0-1)

## Phase 8: Issue Resolution & Optimization (Time varies)

### Step 8.1: Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue:** "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"
- **Fix:** Create .env file with API key
- **Verify:** `type .env` shows the key

**Issue:** Predictions are slow (>30s)
- **Possible causes:**
  - API rate limiting
  - Network latency
  - Depth=3 complexity
- **Fix:** Use depth=2, check internet connection

**Issue:** Low confidence scores (<0.5)
- **Possible causes:**
  - Uncommon drug-target pairs
  - Limited biological knowledge
- **Action:** 
  - Add more context
  - Use well-studied drugs for testing
  - Treat low confidence as exploratory

**Issue:** No results shown
- **Possible causes:**
  - Min confidence too high
  - API error
  - No targets found for drug
- **Fix:**
  - Lower min confidence slider
  - Check logs for API errors
  - Verify drug has targets in database

### Step 8.2: Performance Optimization

**If predictions are consistently slow:**

1. **Check API key is valid:**
   ```python
   # In Python console
   import os
   print(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))  # Should show your key
   ```

2. **Monitor API usage:**
   - Free tier: 60 requests/min
   - Check you're not hitting rate limits
   - Use batch prediction with delays

3. **Use caching:**
   - Uncheck "Force New Prediction"
   - Reuse existing predictions when possible
